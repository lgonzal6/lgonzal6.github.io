#### Description
Dog shelters suffer from a high rate of dog breed misclassifications. Dog breeds, however, can provide import insight into a dog’s health and behavioral predispositions. Therefore, I sought to test whether a Convolutional Neural Network can improve breed classification rates. I used InceptionV3 for the model’s architecture, paired with EarlyStop and ReduceLROnPlateau. For the training and validation images, I used the Stanford Dog Dataset. Despite several issues with the dataset, the model achieved an 86% accuracy across all breeds, furthermore, 60% of breeds had recall scores of 90% or more.

#### Description
Conservationist at Tai National Park have set up trap cameras at 148 sites throughout the park in order to study the animals that call the park home. The camera traps are meant to capture pictures of these animals and are triggered by movement or heat. It’s not easy for conservationist to go through thousands of photos and identify the species in each frame. Therefore, our team set out to train a CNN model to identify six different animal species (and blank images). Images from the trap cameras presented many challenges, for instance, many images were taken at night, many images were not focused, and some only showed a partial image of the animal. Due to such difficulties, our model achieved an accuracy score of 46%. Nonetheless, this project highlights methods such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and evaluating classification metrics.
