#### Description
Dog shelters suffer from a high rate of dog breed misclassifications. Dog breeds, however, can provide import insight into a dog’s health and behavioral predispositions. Therefore, I sought to test whether a Convolutional Neural Network can improve breed classification rates. I used InceptionV3 for the model’s architecture, paired with EarlyStop and ReduceLROnPlateau. For the training and validation images, I used the Stanford Dog Dataset. Despite several issues with the dataset, the model achieved an 86% accuracy across all breeds, furthermore, 60% of breeds had recall scores of 90% or more.
